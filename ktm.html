        <div class="d11">
            <p>The<b> KTM 390 Duke </b>are 373.2 cc (22.77 cu in) displacement single-cylinder engine motorcycles assembled by Bajaj Auto, and KTM Asia Motorcycle Manufacturing, Inc. (KAMMI) for the Austrian manufacturer KTM. The bikes were developed under a joint program of Bajaj and KTM engineers, in which the concept was developed in Austria, while everything else, including design and final product development, was done in India by Bajaj. The 390 Duke standard debuted at the 2012 EICMA show in Milan, Italy, and went on sale in India and the Philippines in 2013 and in the US in 2015. The RC 390 sport bike was presented at EICMA the following year. After the Duke's initial release, KTM CEO Stefan Pierer announced plans to export the 390 Duke to the US for 2014. Bajaj said eventually the bike will be sold in 80 countries worldwide.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">390 Duke</h2><hr><br>
            <p><b>The 390 Duke's</b> engine size and weight place it in the mid-range category, and it sells for more than three times the average price of a motorcycle in India. As one Indian reviewer put it "The 390 Duke may well be a simple little A2 license commuter for the European rider, but in the environs of Mumbai traffic, it's a proper rocket-powered scalpel." In the US market, the same motorcycle is considered small-displacement, lightweight, and relatively inexpensive. Similarly, the UK Sunday Times said, "Given that the 390 Duke weighs less than 150kg when it's full of fuel, you have to sit on it to stop it blowing away. It's as agile in traffic as a push-bike and whippet-thin," saying the bike was ideal for young riders with the A2 license, limited to 47 bhp (35 kW), who would find it easy to ride and confidence-inspiring, while feeling "fast and sporty". Such a bike in the UK would also appeal to experienced riders looking for a practical and efficient commuter bike and runabout. The 390 Duke won the 2013–14 Jury's Choice Bike of the Year in The Bloomberg TV India Autocar India Awards. IndianCarsBikes said that with a top speed of 160 km/h (99 mph) and a 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) time of 5.5 seconds, the 390 Duke is the fastest motorcycle made in India as of January 2014</p>
            <h3>2017 update</h3>
            <p>After 2017, the 390 series' front brake disc was increased from 300 mm to 320 mm. The headlight was redesigned and converted to LED. The display became a color TFT panel with phone pairing capability. Seat height was increased from 800 mm (31.5 in) to 830 mm (32.7 in) and wheelbase was decreased 10 mm. The brake and clutch levers were also made manually adjustable.[20] The throttle now uses a ride by wire system and the tank was updated from 11 to 13.5 L (2.9 to 3.6 US gal).</p>
            <h3>2018 update</h3>
            <p>n 2018, KTM updated its Duke 390 with some minor changes, where it added a deflector plate on the left side of the chassis, to avoid exhaust heat near the riders leg. The Duke 390 in India gained new features and updates. The Duke 390 comes with a daytime running light, and is on Euro IV emission standards.</p>
            <h3>2020 update</h3>
            <p>The bike was made BS6 compliant and a bi-directional quickshifter was added.</p>
            <h3>2022 update</h3>
            <p>3 new colors are available for the 2022 Duke, which was launched in India at an ex-showroom price of ₹2.7 lakh .</p>
